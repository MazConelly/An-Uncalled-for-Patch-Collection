	<string id="st_roubles_coin_descr">
		<text>A tiny collection of dull, dirt-caked Soviet kopecks from across the decades; taken at face value, they're not even worth 10 rubles. Even then, many of the coins are worn smooth, or oxidized to the point that even the most desperate stalker wouldn't see them as anything more than simple trinkets. Outside of the Zone these historic coins are simple collector's items, and inside of the Zone their use is equally limited. Some stalkers carry these for luck, others for simple barters and bets. Though, certain stalkers may prefer sticking to cash to keep sound to a minimum.\n \n

	<string id="st_roubles_tiny_descr">
		<text>A meager handful of crinkled, worn-out Soviet roubles from the early 90s; taken at face value, there's no more than 100 roubles. However, most of the bills are damaged and stained to the point that even the most desperate stalker wouldn't accept them. Outside of the Zone these retired banknotes are simple collector's items, but they have found new life as an internal currency with stalkers, who find them useful for backing everyday trades of basic goods. Certain stalkers may also appreciate the lack of digital footprint, when compared to wiring funds through their PDAs.\n \n
