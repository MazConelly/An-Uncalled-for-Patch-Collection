		<text>Ah, another new face. No, not a bandit, I'm a mercenary, so I work with anyone who's willing to pay. Needle is the name, I'm the medic around these parts, and yes, I'm an ACTUAL medic, not one of those butchers the bandits used to have. When you get hurt out there (And you will) come to see me and I'll patch you up, for a reasonable price, of course...</text>

	<string id="ask_medic_dv_bandit_1">
		<text>Umm, are YOU going to give me trouble? Nevermind... To answer your question, only the stupid ones do, sometimes. But most of them know that it’s not a good idea to harass their only medic, no matter how horny they may be. Besides, Sultan likes having me around and the majority of his men know better than to go against his wishes. The ones that not... Well they usually end up with a price on their heads.</text>
