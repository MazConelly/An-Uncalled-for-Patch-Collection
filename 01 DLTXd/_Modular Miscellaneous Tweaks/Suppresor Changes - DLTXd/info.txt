Adding a suppressor to your gun now applies the following:

+3% bullet speed
+1% gun accuracy
-18% hipfire recoil
-18% aimed recoil
+5% hipfire accuracy (stationary)
-5% hipfire accuracy (moving)
-15% hipfire accuracy (turning)
25% faster gun degradation (due to increased back-pressure and suppressor needing cleaning)

These are all easily editable in the .ltx file.
