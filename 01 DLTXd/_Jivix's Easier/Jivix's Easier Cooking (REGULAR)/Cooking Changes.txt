'Cooking' Balance Changes

Easy Mode
Vanilla cooking is nonsensical. A major issue with the cooking system is that high-tier cooking is actually much cheaper (700 per op with multi-fuel+kerosene) than the low tier cooking (1200 per op with cooking kit + charcoal). This is much more expensive than food items cost, so there is literally no reason to ever buy cooking supplies.

Easy Mode changes things to make cooking cheaper to do yourself, you might even be able to turn a small profit on lower difficulties. I don't think these price changes have a significant effect on game economy, it is still very inefficient to pursue the path of animal hunting. This is at least a step in the right direction though and makes DIY survival a lot less painful.

An attempt was made to make each piece of cooking gear useful in some way. Previously the meta was very unbalanced, the gear was either the cheapest AND lightest or heavy AND expensive. There was never any reason to use ANYTHING but kerosene. I have inverted this relationship, so now heavier fuels generally cost less. This makes a lot more sense from a value standpoint. One side effect of this is their usefulness as explosives is better as they are less expensive per unit, but I am not intending to balance that aspect of these items :)

Total cooking costs now vary from 276 to (546 + cost of Multifuel Stove), down from 903 to 1300, a cost reduction of 40-80%.
Total weight costs are reduced as well, with the new lightest being .146 kilos per operation, way down from an astronomical 0.91kg per operation. The maximums were reduced too, 0.71kg down from 1.55. So a 55-85% reduction, even more so than prices.

Of course, the devil is in the details, which I have included below:

Stoves
Field Cooking Kit + charcoal
-Highest pack weight needed per cooking operation compared to other stoves (and fuels).
-You have to use a multifuel stove 86 times to equal the cost effectiveness of this cheap stove.

Army Kettle + charcoal
-15% higher cost than Fieldkits, per operation (317 instead of 276).
-Huge weight reduction compared to vanilla, enforcing it as the ideal option for long field adventures (if that's what you want to do). Just remember to bring enough charcoal.

Multi-fuel Stove
-Already an excellent stove thanks to infinite uses, so no significant changes made.
-Dropped weight to .42 from 0.93 to help reinforce its status as a lightweight option.
-It's always going to be a bit more to run this than FCK+Charcoal, but considering charcoal isn't always readily available this is a better option for doing loads of cooking.

Fuels
Charcoal (The truly cheapskate option)
-Weight/operation (when full) now at 0.38kg from 0.91, which is closer to what it takes to cook 2 lbs of meat on an efficient grill in reality.

Gas Balloon ("Cheapest" fuel)
-Changed name to Propane Tank, because I like it better.
-Tied with Kettle for cost effectiveness (which is 15% more than Fieldkit), but loses by a hair because you have to sink a lot of money into the multifuel stove, and you have to cook a HUGE amount of meat to offset this. It's effectively 12% more expensive than the Kettle if you use it to cook "just" 256 items. That jumps to 24% more if you only cook 128 items! Oof! Of course, if you were going to buy a stove anyway, then you can exclude it from the calculation in which case they return to being neck and neck.
-However, it gets curb stomped by the Kettle in weight effectiveness, needing 36% more weight per operation. That's the price you  pay for high tier cooking my friend!
-Around 50-60% heavier than it would be in reality to maintain game balance. This should be the item you avoid bringing on long trips due to its high weight. If you've ever carried a propane tank in person, you will understand why Stalkers avoid lugging these hunks of steel around.

Jerry Fuel Can (Balanced Weight/Price)
-35% more expensive than Fieldkits, not counting Multifuel stove.
-18% more expensive than Propane, but only 40% the weight. A good balanced option between Kerosene and Propane, it can be carried without too much struggle but it is 32% cheaper than Kerosene. Kerosene is half the weight, in case you were wondering.

Kerosene (Lightest Option)
-98% more expensive than Fieldkits, not counting Multifuel price. This sounds like a lot but that is only because field kits are extremely cheap. Later in the game the convenience of extra carry space on long journeys should be worth the few hundred Rubles. Don't get me wrong, this is still definitely the most expensive option, but the price different is smaller than from the cheapest to most expensive options in vanilla, and now you pay for a space savings bonus.
-This fuel is by far the most space efficient as it doesn't need special storage containers. Kerosene is also a little higher test than diesel or propane, by weight, so it is more space efficient in that way too.



Regular Mode
Most of the changes above, except I kept the price-per-operation exactly the same as vanilla. So you'll get the carry weight advantages due to the higher item quantities and the rebalancing of fuels to be more true-to-life, which will help make the game a little easier without directly changing the economy. 
-This does make the cost of explosives a lot higher, so your offensive uses of fuels will lower significantly. But you probably use grenades, right?
