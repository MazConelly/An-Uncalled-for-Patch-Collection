		%c[ui_gray_1]Spray can containing oil intended for lubricating and protecting firearms. Application will help prevent guns from malfunctioning and corroding after prolonged use in combat situations. Prior to lubrication, it is advisable to make use of basic tools to access the inner parts of a gun in order to maximize the effectiveness of the spray. Before use be sure to properly clean the firearm to remove any foreign material that has accumulated on or inside it. A proprietary "Tuboline" additive increases gliding quality of all movable parts making the oil even better suited for precision repeaters and automatic weapons. This Swiss formula allows guns to function at temperatures of as low as -55 °C. It has a flash point of 78 °C.\n \n

		%c[ui_gray_1]Iconic Red Army oil that has been in service for almost 70 years. The metal bottle is divided into two separate compartments, one for oil and the other one for the cleaning solvent. In the beginning, the solvent was based on an alkaline solution for effective clean-up of salts from corrosive Berdan primers. Since then, the composition of liquids has been modernized, but the simple yet ingenious 'double' bottle design remained unchanged. "Dvojka" is very popular in the Exclusion Zone due to its reliability in the field. Bear in mind, the solvent works best when spread with a cloth so it can evenly coat a weapon's inner mechanisms.\n \n

Despite its low quality nature, it can prove useful in keeping a firearm in a good condition if applied frequently and carefully using a good cloth. According to the manufacturer, "Rusak" is especially effective for automatic and repeatable weapons due to low friction coefficient. It is advertised as containing various anti-corrosion and metal-preserving additives, but it is just ordinary mineral oil.\n \n

Comes with an additional bottle of Hoppe's No. 9 Lubricating Oil to prevent clean metal surfaces from rusting again. Although it is designed to flow freely and penetrate rapidly, it is still advisable to use cleaning tools or fabrics to ensure good coverage.\n \n

		%c[ui_gray_1]M17 is a result of a Soviet military-industrial research project intended to devise an extremely potent, two-component adhesive which could be used in any situation regardless of purpose and materials involved. It was decided to use a highly potent epoxy which is most often optimized for reacting with either plastic or metal. In case of M17, however, this limitation has been bypassed, making the substance equally effective in both areas. In addition, the adhesive received a significant boost to versatility thanks to its hydrate form: it can be diluted with water and used in any concentration depending on the intended result. Thanks to the lack of solvents this glue can work safely and effectively on any material. Usable with any patch materials available in the Zone.\n \n

		%c[d_orange] • %c[ui_gray_2] all outfits and light headgear sets\n \n
		%c[ui_gray_1]A repair set allowing the user to perform short notice repairs of outfits and bodyarmor. Includes military grade double sided adhesive tape and ready-to-use sheets of ballistic nylon in a variety of shapes and sizes which make it possible to quickly patch up any damage. This is especially useful to prevent further structural damage of compromised suits. Due to the inclusion of fiberglass sheets and fast curing epoxy resin the kit is still effective for repairing harder materials like kevlar and metal in a hurry.\n \n

		%c[d_orange] • %c[ui_gray_2] medium and heavy headgear sets\n \n
		%c[ui_gray_1]This kit contains everything that is needed to perform effective repair of modern combat helmets. It features heavy tools that will allow you to work on hard materials such as kevlar, steel or titanium, as well as a very strong, methacrylate-based adhesive. As the kit does not contain any sewing equipment, it cannot be effectively utilized for reparation of flexible materials of armors, but it can be used to disassemble headgear sets to greatly improve the effectiveness of repair.\n \n
