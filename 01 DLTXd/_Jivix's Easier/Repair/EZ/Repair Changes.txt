'Repair' Balance Changes

Easy Mode
-In general, repair is substantially cheaper, especially maintaining gear at a high state of repair.
-Modified progression when offering basic/advanced/expert tools to gunsmiths. Now you start off with both handgun and shotgun, basic tools unlocks small rifles, advanced tools unlocks big rifles. It's just too unfair as it is.

MISCELLANEOUS TOOLS
-Swiss knife lasts ~2.5x longer, it's a good knife.
-Grooming kit lasts ~1.5x longer, scissors shouldnt wear out quite that quick.
-Box of matches has 30 uses now, from 10. It's a box, not a pack of matches!

SHARPENING STONE (0%+)
Using sharpening stones is incredibly annoying and gets old fast. Halved cost, doubled repair bonus, and doubled uses.

LUBRICANTS/SOLVENTS (80%/83%/88%/90%+)
Mostly meant to be used as a crafting aid, but can be used to keep guns maintained at high durability, particularly the Russian variants for economy of field repairs (half the cost), while the Westerners excel at repair bonuses efficiency (2-4x the bonus but the price is similar). Made the rock/paper/scissors more obvious. Lubricants are now clearly for higher minimum conditions, while solvents can handle more grime (lower conditions). Despite these changes it can still be better to use kerosene, steel wool, and/or industrial grease when available.
Maintenance Oils: Used for "finishing" gun maintenance. When used standalone, only work at a higher condition. CANNOT work with gunsmithing kits as the replacement parts come pre-oiled (and for balance reasons because they are too cheap).
Rusak - Rebalanced to be a budget option for maintenance of well-kept weapons. This will generally work better on highly reliable weapons as the minimum condition for use is high.
Brunox - Offers a repair bonus on par with better materials, and being nearly as cheap to run as Rusak means it is a better choice for more expensive maintenance operations. It's the same cost efficiency as the previous best, the original Hoppe's.
Solvents + Oils: Can handle rougher gun conditions on their own. Can be used alongside gunsmithing toolkits AND cleaning kits to help clean up dirty parts.
Dvojka - Cheapest low-condition direct repairs. Best solvent alternative to weapon cleaning kits. Decent choice for kit repairs but not as cost effective as Brunox since you're using more solvent than oil.
Hoppe's - Provides a great bonus when doing your most expensive repairs, a whopping 10%.

CLEANING KITS (70%+)
-Dropped 
-Dropped minimum condition for cleaning for all weapons to 70% from 75%.
Universal Weapon Maintenance Kit (55%+)
-Reduced minimum repair condition to 55% from 65%.
-Increased repair bonus to equal standalone repair amount (now you can just use it with your repair kits if desired without wasting half your money), although this prevents you from using a repair part with it in turn. So it's not really that much better, but it's not quite as pointless now.
-Increased number of uses (and price to 12852 from 11139) to help drive home the fact that this isn't exactly an early game item. Increased weight to reflect the amount of parts this thing holds.
-Increased repair bonus from 9% to 10% to offset the inconvenience and bring it in line with the weapon repair kits, a drop to 371 Ru per 1% from 413. If the sticker price still seems shocking consider you can get a massive 20% total improvement to the weapon along with a total repair cost savings of ~33% if you use 1800 Ru worth of Hoppe's as a repair part.

GUNSMITHING REPAIR KITS (40%+)
-Reduce minimum quality because there's no way everyone in the Zone can afford to repair their shitty guns exclusively at gunsmiths.
-Reduced price of Handgun Repair Kit to 11470 from 15660, it was unfairly high and close to shotguns in cost and not far from full on rifles. One thing that pisses me off about the default values is how unfairly the game treats sidearms, almost as expensive to maintain as rifles despite being much smaller and easier to do maintenance on in the field. An interesting side effect of the lowered cost is that Hoppe's becomes noticeably less effective, although still results in a 19% net savings. Also a clever player might notice it's now cheaper to use Handgun Repair kits instead of Universal kits to bring a handgun up to snuff. This makes sense in reality as there are fewer parts in a handgun that can fail without causing catostrophic damage as compared to a rifle or shotgun, so if its damaged you might as well replace parts instead of tinker. I guess this is true of modular rifles as well but for balance reasons I don't want to upset that too much. Hoppe's improvements will have to be good enough.
-Shotgun repair kit now uses Handgun kit's old price, 15660 from 17660.

GLUES (85%/90%/95%+)
-Changed descriptions of glues to indicate that they are talking about bonus repair materials, since they all can work on any type of armor. Also removed mention of hides since they are no longer used by them. (medium glue can additionally use kevlar, and extreme glue can use kevlar and metal plates). Also changed references to chemical makeup to reflect performance of real world glues.
-Glues are now a bad choice for maintenance by themselves, needing higher minimum conditions. However they are now very handy accompanyments to sewing kits. Accomplished this by doubling their number of uses and increasing the part repair bonus while decreasing the normal repair bonus. If you use them separately with fabrics they are more expensive than emergency repair kits but will work in a pinch.
-Like with the sewing kits, these glues are now tiered by armor type, except they all work on both kinds of helmet. Which doesn't really matter much when you consider most of the time you'll be using the sewing kits (which are also tiered, muahaha).
-Like the gun lubricants, I have removed the ability for glues to be used as a part for other glues. Use some fabric with it, you weirdos.

EMERGENCY ARMOR REPAIR SET (85%+)
-Change description of "Emergency armor repair set" to reflect its ability to repair any armor (except exos), not just lighter armors.
-Added an extra use, dropped the durability gain slightly, ends up being cheaper than sewing kits, but of course only if it's over 85%. Same repair efficiency as basic sewing kit if used as a repair part. It's definitely the cheapest way to maintain armor.
-Removed the ability for this kit to work on exo armor, because it's way too cheap for those suits, which have so much armor they won't be dropping below 85% as long as you're keeping an eye on it. You'll have to use a Heavy smithing kit on the Exos for field repairs.

SEWING KITS (50%/60%/70%+)
-Now actually cheaper than repair toolkits. Why did small maintenance items cost more than a full armor reconstruction kit? Nobody knows.
-Increased sewing kit repair amount to 10% from 8%, it's just so tiring to repair things over and over, hopefully this will help a bit with that.
-Removed ability for repair kits to use higher tier repair kits as parts. It'll usually be far cheaper to use them separately, so might as well remove this option to make less confusing for players.
-Basic kit can handle only light and medium armor now, including "light" helmets.
-Advanced kit can handle heavy armor and regular helmets in addition the basic kit items.
-Smithing kit (formerly heavy sewing kit) are intended for exosuits. In fact, smithing kits and exo repair kits are the only way to repair exosuits now. Exosuits need to be expensive to maintain as they are pretty OP.
-Changed names and flavor text a bit to improve its accuracy and allude to what it is meant to be used for. Basic sewing kit sounds a lot less lame now. Now you don't feel as silly having 3 different sewing kits.
-Increased weight of the advanced and heavy kits because they are not tiny baby kits. Now the advanced kit has a couple pounds of fabric included, and the smithing kit's got welding tools so its around 4 kilos.

ARMORSMITHING REPAIR KITS (15%/35%/45%/50%)
-Made minimum repair quality vary from 15%-50% based on outfit type, from a flat 50% . Now if you want to blow tons of kits on repairing some armor you want to use, you can now often do it without having to kill loads of people wearing the same armor for parts.
-Doubled repair amount per use of repair kits. Now they are noticeably better than sewing kits as they consume fewer materials.
-Dramatically lowered repair kit cost for light armor by doubling the number of uses.
-Dropped cost of medium armor kit to 14360 from 17360. This puts it just below heavy armor's repair cost.

HELMET REPAIR KIT (25%+)
-Increased minimum durability from 20% to 25%.
Weapon Component Repair Tools (10%+)
-Halved price of repair tools
-Increased durability gain to 100% - now only need to use it on part once to get full durability.
-Updated description of "Multitool" to clarify functionality.
-Small correction to text of Rasp/"File" tool: changed mention of "barrel" to "bolt" and "gas tube" to reflect the parts the item can actually repair.
-Small correction of text of "Ramrod" to clarify they are wooden rods.
Armor Component Repair Tools (10%+)
Same changes as weapon component tools.
-Correct typo and translation on "Basic Sewing Thread", and clarify that it works on fabrics.
-Correct typo and clarify "Field Armor Toolkit" repairs ballistics in addition to retardants.



Regular Mode
All of the Easy Mode changes, except: 
-No changes to Engineer repair kit offering progression.
-Prices changed to be identical or closer to vanilla. As in, it should cost close to what vanilla would. This means items where quantity increased will cost significantly more than before, but cost per use will remain similar. Some items where the values were changed significantly will experience a price shift relative to vanilla (whether the price is changed based on the change in repair bonus or added condition is what I perceive to be the more important value)
-Minimum usage conditions are kept the same as vanilla for cleaning and repair kits. Sewing kits are kept 5% less because they really are broken.
-Part repair tools benefit from condition increase without modifying their price. It's absolutely not fun to use them 1-3 times on the same damaged part by opening the UI over and over.



Very Easy Mode
All of the Easy Mode changes, except:
-Medium armor repair kits available at every Engineer by default, Heavy unlocked with basic tools, Exo unlocked with advanced tools. Since everything is now unlocked, expert tools makes them offer you a 20% discount on all their stock.
-Significantly reduced minimum condition requirements for maintenance and repair kits, so you can even more easily get good quality weapons inexpensively.
-Prices of weapon toolkits are lowered by 25%.
-Prices of armor repair kits lowered by 33%.
--Doubled uses of cleaning kits.
-Doubled uses of sewing kits.
-Tripled the number of uses of parts repair tools. 
-The Multitool will last four times as long for disassembly. Wanted to get this working for repair as well but can't find the code for it.



Note: This mod modifies the same trade_generic_mechanic.ltx as the Ammo mod, sets the minimum sell condition to 1% (line 8), allows for sale of weapons to the mechanic, and Very Easy additionally unlocks repair kits at 1 tier earlier reputation.
