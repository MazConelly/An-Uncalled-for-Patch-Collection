'Damage' Balance Changes

Easy Mode
Contains a variety of changes to the player/actor that make the game less unforgiving. It sucks having to reload your save because you entered a new area right next to a bandit.
-However, no changes to the damage you take from anomalies.
-Cleaned up actor.ltx so that it is much easier to read
-Translated russian comments into english
-Added comments to confusing fields that I have learned the effect of

Damage
-Increased wound recovery to .0006 from .0002.
-Changed bleed_speed_k to 0.44 from 0.88.
-Actor now takes only about 2/3 the damage to health, hopefully resulting in fewer insta-kills.

Encumbrance (experimental)
-Increased normal carry to 100kg, and maximum weight limit to 200kg. I believe this means if you set your normal carry to 60kg in game, your maximum weight will be about 120kg. Or it might be linear, and you can just always carry 100kg more. Still testing.

Energy
-Dropped critical calorie level to 10% from 20%.
-Increased health restoration from spending calories by 50%.

Movement
-1/2 stamina drain for walking and ~1/2 the penalty caused by weight factors. If you're sprinting or overweight you'll still run out, just not as quickly. Which is fine because it takes a long time to regenerate.
-Slightly reduced the point where you run out of breath for both walking and sprinting, but not enough to really be noticeable.
-Decreased crouch move speed from .65 to .45 (it was faster than walking, at 0.61), increased run move speed slightly, and reduced sprint coefficient slightly to result in same sprint speed



Very Easy Mode
Basically the same as Easy mode, except with:
-Small amount of natural health regeneration (same as vanilla Call of Pripyat I think, 0.0001).
-increased resistances against elemental damage across all difficulties. Original Stalker immunities are now the Master immunities, for comparison, so it is a significant reduction.
-Increased health restoration from spending satiety by 100%.
-Increased wound recovery to .0008 from .0002.



Regular Mode
 Basically the same as Easy mode except:
-Only a 10% reduction in health damage.
-You bleed out at 3/4 the vanilla speed.
