Welcome and thanks for downloading my first addon. 
The goal of this addon is to make clear sky gear actually useful.
If you have balancing suggestions for me, contact me on Discord at @Maracia#0472.

Thanks and have fun!

P.S., use the Trader Overhaul Patch if using that addon so your game doesn't break. M
Mod load order in JGSME should be Trader Overhaul>MCSGA>Compatibility Patch

Changed values so certain armors were at more appropriate tiers.
Increased psy resistance on the heavier armors for better fighting conditions in areas like Radar and CNPP.
Increased Psy resistance on SEVAs.
Check the comparison images to see the differences between vanilla and the add-on.
Thanks for all the input and the warm welcome into the modding community.
