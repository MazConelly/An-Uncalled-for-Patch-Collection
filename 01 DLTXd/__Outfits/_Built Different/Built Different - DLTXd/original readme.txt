The reason for this mod is because I came to the realization that a lot of the gear in STALKER: Anomaly has exaggerated weights. I've decided to take up the effort of creating
a basic overhaul toward all of the uniforms in the game. I'll be using the in-game descriptions and images of each armor to find their real life counterparts to determine
weight, reliability, ballistic protection, and so on. Also just to simplify any armor adjustments, I'll be using the American NIJ armor index rather than the Russian GRAU index
for simplicity's sake.

Here's a reference to the NIJ's body armor standard: https://www.google.com/search?q=nij+armor+levels&rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS932US932&sxsrf=ALeKk03vSgLMXwffLfY8D0DwqInlWS1Rbw:1621365244461&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjqocmb-NPwAhV3AZ0JHcJUDDYQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=1920&bih=937#imgrc=zc7MAS25-2vWHM

0.1: Adjusting basic equipment weights accordingly (Body armor, helmets, bags.)
0.2: Release. I want as much constructive criticism as I can get.
