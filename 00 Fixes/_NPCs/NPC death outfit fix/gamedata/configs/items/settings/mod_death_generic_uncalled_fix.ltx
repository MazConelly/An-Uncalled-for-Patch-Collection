![outfit_by_visual]
;lets reenable some entries. At least those that seem viable
;If two or more different models would drop the same outfit, good
;if one model would drop two outfits, no touchy
;stalker_freedom4nosorog also drops freedom_nosorog_outfit. No reason why stalker_freedom_10 can't (Duty has 3 models to drop their exo)
stalker_freedom_10		= freedom_nosorog_outfit
;same as above
stalker_monolith_6		= monolith_nosorog_outfit
;stalker_bandit_seva2 also drops this, and most other factions have two models dropping their normal seva
stalker_bandit_seva1	= bandit_scientific_outfit
;same as above
stalker_nebo_seva_1		= cs_scientific_outfit
stalker_freedom2b_mas3	= svoboda_light_outfit,helm_cloth_mask 
stalker_monolith1		= monolith_outfit
stalker_monolith_2_old	= monolith_outfit,helm_respirator_old
stalker_monolith2a_old	= monolith_outfit,helm_respirator_old
