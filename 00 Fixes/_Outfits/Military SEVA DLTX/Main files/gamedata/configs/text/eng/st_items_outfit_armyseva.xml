		<text>%c[ui_gray_1]This suit was produced by one of Kiev's defence research institutes and represents an excellent alternative to hand-made stalker suits. It combines a closed cycle breathing system and an integrated system of anomalous field suppression with a more than adequate ballistic vest. Due to the perfect materials, this suit is a good choice. Still, it is expensive, and those who prefer pitched battle over careful anomaly investigation are advised to look elsewhere.\n \n
